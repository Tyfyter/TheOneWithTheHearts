Heart of Magic was supposed to be an overhaul to hearts because I thought of a pun.
instead the hearts just go over your normal ones because it would be incompatible with a lot of mods and way more complicated otherwise.

Changelog:
0.5.0.1:
fixed recipes

0.5:
completely rewrote the majority of the mod

0.1.1 (latest released version):
fixed a few progression bugs

Special thanks to:
The tmodloader team.
The 11 people who downloaded this before I even released 0.1.1
