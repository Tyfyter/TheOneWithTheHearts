Heart of Magic was supposed to be an overhaul to hearts because I thought of a pun.
instead the hearts just go over your normal ones because it would be incompatible with a lot of mods and way more complicated otherwise.

Changelog:
0.1.2:
fixed health potions not working on mod hearts when all of them are empty.
unfortunately I can't fix being unable to quick use health potions when at full health without completely re-implimenting quick healing.

0.1.1 (latest released version):
fixed a few progression bugs

Special thanks to:
The tmodloader team.
The 11 people who downloaded this before I even released 0.1.1
